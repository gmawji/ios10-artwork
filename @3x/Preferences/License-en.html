You agree that the terms of this License will apply to any Apple-branded app that may be pre-installed on your iOS Device, unless such app is accompanied by a separate license, in which case you agree that the terms of that license will govern your use of that app.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">(b) Apple, at its discretion, may make available future iOS Software Updates for your iOS Device. The iOS Software Updates, if any, may not necessarily include all existing software features or new features that Apple releases for newer or other models of iOS Devices.  The terms of this License will govern any iOS Software Updates provided by Apple that replace or supplement the Original iOS Software product, unless such iOS Software Update is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.</p>

Before executing any securities transaction based upon information obtained through the Services, you should consult with a financial or securities professional who is legally qualified to give financial or securities advice in your country or region. Location data provided by any Services, including the Apple Maps service, is provided for basic navigational and planning purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental damage. You agree that, the results you receive from the Maps service may vary from actual road or terrain conditions due to factors that can affect the accuracy of the Maps data, such as, but not limited to, weather, road and traffic conditions, and geopolitical events.

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">(j) In addition, Services and Third Party Materials that may be accessed, linked to or displayed on the iOS Device are not available in all languages or in all countries or regions. Apple makes no representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access such Services and Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws and privacy and data collection laws. Sharing or syncing photos through your iOS Device may cause metadata, including photo location data, to be transmitted with the photos. Apple and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Apple be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such Services.

<p class="p1"><b>Apple Pay Supplemental Terms and Conditions</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">These Apple Pay Supplemental Terms and Conditions (the “Supplemental Terms”) supplement the iOS Software License Agreement (the “License”); both the terms of the License and these Supplemental Terms govern your use of the Apple Pay feature, which shall be deemed a “Service” under the License.  Capitalized terms used in these Supplemental Terms have the meanings set forth in the License.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>1 Overview and Use Restrictions</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Apple Pay allows you to store virtual representations of credit, debit and prepaid cards, including store credit, debit and prepaid cards, which are supported by the Apple Pay feature (“Supported Payment Cards”) and use supported iOS Devices to make contactless payments in select locations, or within apps or websites.  Apple Pay also allows you to use rewards and gift cards that are saved in Wallet (“Apple Pay-Enabled Cards”, and together with Supported Payment Cards, “Supported Cards”) to make contactless rewards and gift card transactions in select stores as part of a contactless payment using Apple Pay. The Apple Pay features of the iOS Software may only be available in select regions, with select card issuers, and with select merchants. Features may vary by region, issuer, and merchant. </p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In order to use Apple Pay, you must have a card supported by the Apple Pay feature.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Supported Cards may change from time to time.  Supported Payment Cards are associated with an active iCloud account in order to use this feature. Supported Cards are only available to individuals aged 13 years or older, and may be subject to additional age-based restrictions imposed by iCloud or the Supported Card which you are trying to provision.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Apple Pay is intended for your personal use and you may only provision your own Supported Cards.  If you are provisioning a supported corporate card, you represent that you are doing so with the authorization of your employer and you are authorized to bind your employer to these terms of use and all transactions effected by use of this feature.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">You agree not to use Apple Pay for illegal or fraudulent purposes, or any other purposes which are prohibited by the License and these Supplemental Terms.  You further agree to use Apple Pay in accordance with applicable law and regulation.  You agree not to interfere with or disrupt the Apple Pay service (including accessing the service through any automated means), or any servers or networks connected to the service, or any policies, requirements or regulations of networks connected to the service (including any unauthorized access to, use or monitoring of data or traffic thereon). </p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>2 Apple’s Relationship With You</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Apple Pay enables you to create a virtual representation of your Supported Cards on your supported iOS Device, however Apple does not process payments or other non-payment card transactions (such as reward accrual and redemption), or have any other control over payments, returns, refunds, rewards, value, discounts or other commerce activity that may arise out of your use of this feature.  The terms of cardholder agreements you may have in place with your card issuer will continue to govern your use of your Supported Payment Cards and their use in connection with Apple Pay. Similarly, your participation in any merchant rewards or gift card programs and your use of Apple Pay-Enabled Cards in connection with Apple Pay will be subject to such merchant’s terms and conditions. Nothing in the License or these Supplemental Terms modifies the terms of any cardholder or merchant agreement, and such terms will govern your use of the applicable Supported Card and its virtual representation on your iOS Device.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">You agree that Apple is not a party to your cardholder or merchant agreements, nor is Apple responsible for the (a) content, accuracy or unavailability of any payment cards, rewards cards, gift cards, commerce activities, transactions or purchases while using Apple Pay functionality; (b) issuance of credit or assessing eligibility for credit; (c) accrual or redemption of rewards or stored value under a merchant’s program; or (d) funding or reloading of prepaid cards.  For all disputes or questions about payment cards, rewards cards, gift cards, or associated commerce activity, please contact your issuer or the applicable merchant.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>3 Privacy</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Apple Pay requires some information from your iOS Device in order to offer the full experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can find more information on the data collected, used or shared as part of your use of Apple Pay by reading About Apple Pay and Privacy (which can be accessed by going to Wallet &amp; Apple Pay on your iOS Device, or within the Watch app on a paired iOS Device) or by visiting <a href="http://www.apple.com/privacy">http://www.apple.com/privacy</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By using Apple Pay, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of all of the foregoing information, to provide Apple Pay functionality.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>4 Security; Lost or Disabled Devices</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Apple Pay stores virtual representations of your Supported Cards and should be protected as you would protect your physical credit, debit, prepaid, rewards and gift cards.  Providing your device passcode to a third party or allowing a third party to add their fingerprint to use Touch ID may result in their ability to make payments and receive or redeem rewards or credit using Apple Pay on your device.   You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your device and of your passcode.  You agree that Apple does not have any responsibility if you lose or share access to your device.  You agree that Apple does not have any responsibility if you make unauthorized modifications to iOS (such as by way of a “jailbreak”).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">If your device is lost or stolen and you have Find My iPhone enabled, you can use Find My iPhone to attempt to suspend the ability to pay with the virtual Supported Payment Cards on the device by putting it into Lost Mode. You can also erase your device, which will attempt to suspend the ability to pay with the virtual Supported Payment Cards on the device and will also attempt to remove the Apple Pay-Enabled Cards. You should also contact the issuer of your Supported Payment Cards and the merchant who issued your Apple Pay-Enabled Cards in order to prevent unauthorized access to your virtual Supported Cards.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">If you report or Apple suspects fraudulent or abusive activity, you agree to cooperate with Apple in any investigation and to use any fraud prevention measures we prescribe.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>5 Limitation of Liability</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">IN ADDITION TO THE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THE LICENSE, APPLE DOES NOT ASSUME ANY LIABILITY FOR PURCHASES, PAYMENTS, TRANSACTIONS, OR OTHER COMMERCE ACTIVITY MADE USING THE APPLE PAY FEATURE, AND YOU AGREE TO LOOK SOLELY TO AGREEMENTS YOU MAY HAVE WITH YOUR CARD ISSUER, PAYMENT NETWORK, OR MERCHANT TO RESOLVE ANY QUESTIONS OR DISPUTES RELATING TO YOUR SUPPORTED CARDS, VIRTUAL SUPPORTED CARDS AND ASSOCIATED COMMERCE ACTIVITY.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">-------------------------</p>
<p class="p1"><b>NOTICES FROM APPLE</b></p>
<p class="p1">If Apple needs to contact you about your product or account, you consent to receive the notices by email. You agree that any such notices that we send you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements.</p>
